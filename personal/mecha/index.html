        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="about-me-info">
            <p>Highly focused and motivated Electrical Service Technician with ten years of experience in the sector. Qualified in Mechatronics, I have been employed with ENERCON as technician during the last eight years working in wind farms to provide maintenance for wind turbines and giving support to other departments such as Installation, Mechanical Maintenance and IT when required. During this period I had the opportunity of being involved in several activities, which I had carried out within the wind farm since the commissioning until the operation.</p>
            <p>Working under pressure is a routine for me. I work well in a team and I am conscious about the influence of my responsibilities on my team to fulfill the goals and the customer’s expectations. I am very enthusiastic about improving myself and developing new skills.</p>
            <p>I also pride myself on building a robust robot (AGV – Automated Guided Vehicle) from scratch as my final project which gave me the opportunity to improve my skills in mechanical CAD design, electronics project and coding for embedded systems and mobile.</p>

                    <p>This is my last and most relevant experience, which I achieved the role of the team leader. Here I had the opportunity of working in the maintenance of wind turbines. I dealt with several types of issues from electrical and electronic to mechanical and some IT troubleshooting. This gave me a good background to work with electrical maintenance in wind turbines. And when required I gave support in new projects for commissioning recently assembled wind turbines.</p>

                    <p>I got here an impressive boost of my developing skills in general, such as programming and electronics. In that period of my academic life I was immersed in several projects, I had the opportunity to use the university lab infrastructure and count on many experienced colleagues.</p>

                    <p>This was my first work experience. Working in a power distribution company in the beginning of my career was very important for me because it gave a practical explanation about how the electric system works.</p>
